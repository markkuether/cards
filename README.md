# cards
This is an OOP exercise in Python to explore probabilities in drawing certain poker hands in a deck of cards. This was inspired by an intro statistics exercise to determine the probability of drawing specific hands. This uses inheritence to expand a basic "deck" object to specific "dealer" and "player" decks. 

## War Card Game
This incoroprates the card objects into a war game simulator. If you are the parent of a 6-9 year old child who has discovered the card game of War, and find yourself drawn into a game with your child, you may wonder "How long does a game of war last?". This simulation is intended to provide the answer with a variable number of players and decks of cards.
